### ABOUT ME

 > Hello there! My name is Anton Shcherba and I'm a 27-year-old front-end developer with a passion for building beautiful and functional websites. Before transitioning to a career in tech, I served in the military for 5 years, where I learned valuable skills such as discipline, attention to details, and problem-solving.<br/>  
 I've always been interested in technology and how it can be used to improve people's lives, so I decided to pursue a career in web development.<br/>  
 In my free time I'm looking for new ways to challenge myself and grow up as a developer. I'm excited to be a part of the tech community and to contribute my skills and knowledge to create innovative solutions that make a difference.
