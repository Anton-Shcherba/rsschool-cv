### ABOUT ME

 > Hello there! My name is Anton Shcherba and I'm a 27-year-old front-end developer with a passion for building beautiful and functional websites. Before transitioning to a career in tech, I served in the military for 5 years, where I learned valuable skills such as discipline, attention to details, and problem-solving.<br/>  
 I've always been interested in technology and how it can be used to improve people's lives, so I decided to pursue a career in web development.<br/>

### CODE EXAMPLE

_**[Currying vs. Partial Application - KATA from CODEWARS](https://www.codewars.com/kata/53cf7e37e9876c35a60002c9):**_ Currying and partial application are two ways of transforming a function into another function with a generally smaller arity. While they are often confused with each other, they work differently. The goal is to learn to differentiate them.  

```javascript
function curryPartial(func, ...args) {
  return args.length >= func.length ? func(...args) : (...rest) => curryPartial(func, ...args, ...rest);
}
```
